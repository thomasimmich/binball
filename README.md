# Binball
## Why
We wanted to create something cool and fancy from plain old garbage. So we had the idea of creating a pinball table that is partially made out of stuff others threw away without caution. The idea of **Binball** was born.

## How 
We went through the woods together with our kids and collected a whole bunch of this garbage. Afterwards, we took the "most interesting" pieces of the collected garbage and spread them on a acryl plate covered with a garbage bag. We then took a short throw projector, projecting a Unity3D based pinball game via backlight projection on this plane.

## What
The result is a original-sized pinball table that has projects a virtual ball that bounces off from real garbage objects. Hard to explain but easy to show. Watch the one of our first videos here:
